# Sentimental-Chat
A real-time chat web app that includes sentiment analysis with Next.js server-side rendering and a Node/Express based back-end.

##How to Use
This program is built to use Pusher (https://pusher.com/) for storing chat messages, and requires several environmental variables provided by the platform to run. You can run it locally by cloning this repository, typing npm install in the directory, setting up an account on pusher and then storing the four required environmental variables in a .env file.

At a later date, once I have made several improvements to this app, I will publish the web app publicly for demoing.
